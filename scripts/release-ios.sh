Default: local preflight only; no key reads, API calls, keychain changes or builds.
--execute: live account/duplicate checks, automatic archive signing, distribution
           export, signature verification, upload and bounded ASC processing check.
Execution also requires ASC_API_SCRIPT pointing to the reviewed Simple Social
scripts/asc_api.py, exactly one ~/private_keys/AuthKey_*.p8, issuer_id.txt,
and the distribution inputs named by apple-signing-for-codex.md.
Eric must be present; no other signing run may be active. This script does not
create ASC apps or assign testers. Never rerun blindly after an uncertain upload.

# --- Disposable release keychain (LM17) -------------------------------------
# PORTED 2026-09-27 from Keto Stack `scripts/release.sh` (the fleet reference,
# at ketostack fe24587), with only these changes: the KS_ names became QE_, the
# lock and temp paths say quiet-exit, the refusal names this app, the
# reference's `release_keychain_cleanup` body is now `release_keychain_teardown`
# (status passed in) behind a trap wrapper of the old name that also runs the
# LM10 shim cleanup and the LM11 completion check, and the keychain directory is
# resolved to its physical path. Each deviation is marked "QUIET EXIT" below. The BUILD nn / Rnn-xx / [Lnn] tags
# in the comments are Keto Stack's review ids and register rows, kept verbatim
# so the two copies still diff cleanly; they are not this repo's LM numbers.
#
# Built here, per run, and torn down by the EXIT trap whatever happens after.
# The password is random and lives only in this run.
#
# WHERE THE PASSWORD TRAVELS, COMMAND BY COMMAND (R10-A4 / R10-B5, build 26).
# It used to be expanded into child-process ARGV six times, which any local user
# can read out of `ps` for the life of the call, under a comment claiming it
# "lives only in this process". Two mechanisms replace it and each is named at its
# own line rather than claimed once at the top:
#
#   * openssl takes it through the ENVIRONMENT (`-passout env:QE_P12_PW`), set as
#     a one-command prefix so it is not in this script's own environment before or
#     after. On macOS another user's environment needs root to read, while another
#     user's argv does not, so this is a real narrowing and not a cosmetic one. It
#     is NOT "in-process": stated here so the next reader does not inherit the
#     claim that was wrong the first time.
#   * every `security` subcommand that takes the password takes it through
#     INTERACTIVE MODE (`security -i`), which reads the command line from stdin
#     and parses it itself, so the only argv is `security -i`. That is the four
#     password-bearing calls: create-keychain, unlock-keychain, import and
#     set-key-partition-list. The subcommands with nothing secret in them
#     (set-keychain-settings, list-keychains, find-identity, delete-keychain,
#     the WWDR import) stay on argv, because moving them would buy nothing and
#     hide what they do.
#
# ONE COMMAND PER `security -i`, AND IT IS MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED.
# Interactive mode accepts a batch of commands on one stdin and exits with the
# status of the LAST one: `printf 'bogus\nlist-keychains -d user\n' | security -i`
# is exit 0 on this Mac, with the failure swallowed. A heredoc carrying all four
# calls would therefore have hidden exactly the failure class R10-B4 is about.
# Measured 2026-09-13 on Xcode 26.6 / macOS 26: a single failing command is 1 or
# 2, good-then-bad is 1, bad-then-good is 0.
#
# BUILD 29 (R12-A8). ONE LOCK ACROSS BOTH SEARCH-LIST EDITS.
#
# The list is read, filtered and written back in two places - `build_release_keychain`
# installs this run's entry, `release_keychain_cleanup` subtracts it - and each is a
# read/modify/write over a resource every release run on this Mac shares. Reading
# close to the write narrows the window and does not close it. Lane A's own
# interleaving, all four commands succeeding: run A's cleanup reads `[A, login]`; run
# B's setup writes `[B, A, login]`; run A writes the `[login]` it computed before B
# existed, and B's live keychain is off the list before B's export asks for it.
#
# `mkdir` is the atomic primitive here: this Mac's /bin/bash is 3.2.57 and has no
# `flock`. The wait is BOUNDED and the timeout FAILS rather than breaking the lock -
# a lock that breaks itself on a timer is not a lock, and the failure mode it would
# restore is the one this exists to remove. A stale lock after a kill -9 is a named
# residue with a one-line remedy, printed in the refusal.
QE_KEYCHAIN_LIST_LOCK="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/quiet-exit-keychain-search-list.lock"

# BUILD 31 (P8, R13-A4 + R13-B3 + R13-A5). THE OWNERSHIP AND THE "DO I HOLD IT"
# ANSWER ARE ONE FACT ON DISK, so a signal cannot land between them.
#
# It used to be `mkdir` plus a shell variable, and the two changed in separate
# steps. Both gaps were measured against build 30 with this script's own extracted
# functions:
#
#   1. SIGNAL AFTER mkdir, BEFORE the flag (R13-B3). The directory existed, the flag
#      still said 0, and the EXIT trap looped `mkdir` against the directory THIS
#      process held: it blocked to the bound, printed the refusal, declined to touch
#      the search list and left the lock on disk. The build-29 wedge, restored.
#   2. SIGNAL AFTER rmdir, BEFORE the flag (R13-A4). The flag still said 1, so the
#      trap's acquire returned 0 AT ONCE against a lock ANOTHER run had since taken,
#      and would have read/modified/written the shared search list underneath it -
#      the lost-update class R12-A8 exists to close. Measured worse than reported:
#      the trap then RELEASED, removing the other run's lock directory.
#
# The remedy is not a third careful ordering, it is removing the second fact. The
# lock is a SYMLINK, which `ln -s` creates in one atomic syscall, and the link's
# TARGET is this run's own token. "Do I hold it" is `readlink`, so the answer is
# read from the thing itself and there is no window in which the two can disagree,
# whatever a signal does and wherever it lands.
#
# The token carries the PID, the second and a random, so a stale lock left by a
# `kill -9` can never be read as ours by a later run that happens to reuse the PID.
QE_KEYCHAIN_LIST_LOCK_TOKEN="quiet-exit.$$.$(date +%s).${RANDOM}"

# The wait ceiling, in seconds. A VARIABLE rather than a literal so the lock gate
# (Keto Stack's `scripts/release-lock-gate.sh`; no copy lives in this repo) can drive the SHIPPED functions to their timeout
# in seconds instead of two minutes: a gate that has to reproduce the constant in a
# copy of these functions is a gate on its own copy.
QE_KEYCHAIN_LIST_LOCK_WAIT="${QE_KEYCHAIN_LIST_LOCK_WAIT:-120}"

# Returns non-zero on timeout; the caller decides whether that is a failure (setup)
# or a reason to leave the list alone (cleanup).
#
# **IT IS RE-ENTRANT, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE OF THE BUILD-29 FIX-ROUND REPAIR.**
# `trap release_keychain_cleanup EXIT` is installed BEFORE `build_release_keychain`
# runs, and the cleanup's own critical section takes this same lock. Every `fail`
# path inside the setup's critical section releases first; a SIGNAL does not. So an
# ordinary Ctrl-C inside the ~1 s window between `search_list_lock_acquire` and
# `search_list_lock_release` used to send the EXIT trap looping `mkdir` against the
# directory THIS process already holds: two minutes of hanging, then the trap
# declining to touch the list, then the disposable keychain left FIRST in the user
# search list and on disk - the exact wedge `[L36]` and `[L68]` exist to prevent -
# and the lock directory outliving the process, so every later release run on this
# Mac waits another two minutes and then fails.
#
# A process cannot be blocked by itself, so the honest answer to "do you hold it" is
# yes, at once. It is NOT a counted lock: the only nesting this script has is the
# EXIT trap, nothing resumes the outer critical section after it, and a depth
# counter would leave the release's last act a `rmdir` it declines to perform.
search_list_lock_is_ours() {
    [[ "$(readlink "$QE_KEYCHAIN_LIST_LOCK" 2>/dev/null)" == "$QE_KEYCHAIN_LIST_LOCK_TOKEN" ]]
}

# **AN OCCUPIED LOCK PATH THAT IS NOT A SYMLINK IS REFUSED BY NAME** (BUILD 32,
# Q7; R15-A3, confirmed by execution).
#
# `ln -s TOKEN LOCK` onto a DIRECTORY exits 0 and creates `LOCK/TOKEN` INSIDE it
# rather than failing, which is documented behaviour and was measured on this Mac:
# exit 0, and the token appearing as a child. Build 30 held this lock as a
# `mkdir` DIRECTORY at the same path. So a build-30 run killed mid-hold leaves a
# directory that every later run's `ln -s` "acquires" - each with a differently
# named child, each returning 0 without owning anything, all of them entering the
# critical section that reads and replaces Eric's keychain search list together.
# `readlink` then fails on a directory, so `search_list_lock_release` declines and
# the directory outlives every run.
#
# The repair is a pre-flight rather than a rescue: the lock path is either absent,
# or it is a symlink whose target is a token. Anything else - a directory from the
# old format, a regular file, a symlink carrying another run's token - is refused
# with the path and the remedy, because breaking a lock this script did not make is
# exactly the removal-of-another-run's-lock that R13-A4 measured.
#
# It is deliberately NOT part of the wait loop: a stale SYMLINK is the documented
# fail-closed residue that the loop waits out and then names, and that behaviour is
# unchanged. This refuses only the shapes that cannot be a lock at all.
#
# **AND A SYMLINK POINTING AT A DIRECTORY IS NOT A LOCK EITHER** (BUILD 32 FIX
# ROUND; R15-A3's own reading, measured by the verifier). `-L` was the FIRST test
# and it returned 0, so a link to a directory sailed through the pre-flight and
# `ln -s` then resolved THROUGH the link and landed the token inside the target:
# `ACQUIRE rc=0 / OWNS no`, the R15-A3 defect verbatim, at the shape rather than at
# the instance. `-d` follows a symlink, so `-L path && -d path` is exactly "a link
# to a directory" and nothing else; a DANGLING link is still the documented
# fail-closed residue the wait loop waits out, unchanged.
#
# **AND A MISSING PARENT DIRECTORY IS NOT ANOTHER RUN** (BUILD 32 FIX ROUND). With
# no directory to create the link in, `ln -s` fails forever, the loop spent the
# whole bound on it and then printed "another Quiet Exit release run has held the
# lock", which is FALSE: nobody holds it and nobody can. A refusal that names the
# wrong cause sends the next person hunting a release that does not exist, so the
# parent is checked first and named.

# BUILD 29 (R12-A7/B1, R12-A8). THE EXIT TRAP STOPS BEING THE SILENT HALF OF THE
# SCRIPT. Three things were wrong with it and all three are the same shape as the
# build-time read this cycle fixed one function down.
#
#   1. The search-list READ was still a process substitution with stderr
#      discarded, so its exit status belonged to a subshell `set -euo pipefail`
#      never looks at. Make securityd unavailable while the script exits: the read
#      fails with no stdout, `remaining` stays empty, the list edit is SKIPPED -
#      and the `delete-keychain` on the next line still runs, so the user search
#      list goes on naming a file that no longer exists. That is `[L68]`'s own
#      sentence arriving one function down, which is `[L71]`'s class exactly:
#      closing an instance is not closing the class.
#   2. `delete-keychain`'s status was discarded too, so a run could fail to remove
#      its own keychain and say nothing at all.
#   3. `rm -rf "$KC_TMP"` destroyed the backing directory whether or not the
#      registration had come off, which turns a recoverable state (a list naming a
#      file that exists) into an unrecoverable one.
#
# AND THE TRAP MUST NOT CHANGE THE RUN'S EXIT STATUS. An EXIT trap runs with `$?`
# from the exiting command; every diagnostic below is printed and the original
# status is restored on the way out, so a failed archive still exits non-zero and
# a clean run still exits 0 even when the cleanup had something to say.
